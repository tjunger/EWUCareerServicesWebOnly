Web Application - AngularJS SPA with a PHP, Slim API, PHP Mailer and a AngularJS web form. 

Built to specifications, using personal research to attempt to create a functional, secure, stable product. 

Pre-Registration site was built by a separate group of students and somewhat modified/refactored. 

Possible Next Steps:
  
  1. Further refactoring of both the SPA admin panel and pre-registration form. 
      - SPA has a known issue with adding and removing questions. Adds blank options if more than 1 question is added.
      - Pre-registration form need to be simplified and further split to make it more maintainable.
      - SPA could use more CSS styling to make it look more inviting to use
      
  2. Originally intended to create a data visualization section to create easy to read reports and summaries of each event.
      - Not a specification but a feature that would make the admin panel more useful.
      - Add line charts for pre - registration dates and check-in times to allow Career Services to visually see tends to allow for better allocation of resources.
      - Add pie charts to easily see year in school of attendees/registrants and school ect.
      - Other charts if they make sense - all charts created by event upon request.
      
  3. Create a better method of securing the APIs than using POST methods with SSL and a key. 
      - Not intent revealing, API should use the standard GET, POST, DELETE, PUT
      

Project was created over a six month period. Most of the APIs were coded and designed by me as well as all of the admin panel.
Some updates of API were created by another group member as well some of the database design and revisions.
